# -- First program in Perl -- 

use strict; #This is called as pragma, this pragma tells perl to enforce rules onto our code
use warnings; #This pragma tells perl to turn on additional warning reporting.
print "Hello, World!\n";
# Unlike TCL, perl does not automatically write to the new line after printing the text. Hence, we need to use "\n" at the end.
print "How is it going?";
